# TicketChecker
Trello ticket checker which checks whether your employees are following the ticket standards or not.

How this works?
1. Your employee create trello ticket.
2. TicketChecker gets the action on webhook.
3. TicketChecker validates the ticket against the standard rules
4. If ticket lack to fit in rules, it send notification on slack channel. Isn't that cool?ðŸ˜Ž
