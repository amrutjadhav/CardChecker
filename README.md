# CardChecker
Trello card checker which checks whether your employees are following the card standards or not.

#### How this works?
1. Your employee creates Trello card.
2. CardChecker gets the action on webhook.
3. CardChecker validates the card against the standard rules
4. If card lack to fit in rules, it sends notification on the Slack/Teams/Flock channel. Isn't that cool?ðŸ˜Ž

#### How to setup?
1. Setting incoming webhook URL. You can choose between Slack, Teams, Flock to publish notifications regarding **CardChecker**.

    - If you are using, Slack as messaging tool, Get the *Slack* incoming webhook for public channel and set to *SLACK_WEBOOK_URL* environment variable.

2. Get *Trello* token and app-key and set it to *TRELLO_TOKEN* and *TRELLO_KEY* environment variables.
  - Trello app key reference = https://trello.com/app-key
  - You can get Trello token for your personal account here = https://trello.com/app-key
  * **Note:**
    *  If you have organization and wants to monitor all boards, whose you are not a member of, then it is recommended that you create a separate user for the app on Trello and add that user to all of your company's board as the app only support single user token for Trello. Then get the app token and key for that user from Trello and use it for API calls.
3. Set the URL of the app to *TRELLO_CALLBACK_URL* environment variable.
4. Set the MongoDB URL to *DB_URI* environment variable.
5. Get the id of your Trello boards using the following endpoint
    - `curl 'https://api.trello.com/1/members/me/boards?key={yourKey}&token={yourToken}'`
6. Subscribe the webhook to Trello board using our configuration API described below

#### Configuration
Everyone has their own unique development flow. Keeping this mind, **CardChecker** provides multiple ways to customize their development pipeline and adjust filters.

1. **Pipeline Config file**
  - This config file allows a user to configure the pipeline and filters. App already has `default_pipeline_config.json` under config directory, which describe default behavior of the app. You can override this file by creating a new file `pipeline_config.json` under same directory. **CardChecker** will append specified configurations on defaults so you don't have to specify all in your file. To know more about the format of the config file, please refer, `config/default_pipeline_config.json`.

2. **CardChecker** uses *Trello* API to fetch card and validate it. To set your app as webhook for *Trello*, **CardChecker** provide useful API.
    -   **POST /configure/subscribe/trello/webhook**
        - To subscribe app URL as webhook for Trello. Trello sends events for every operation on their platform, to this webhook.
        - Params
            1. **description** - To identify the trello webhook
            2. **idModel** - Id of trello board.
